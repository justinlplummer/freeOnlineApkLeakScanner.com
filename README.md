## 🚀 Overview

**Free Online APK Leak Scanner** is a **browser-based security scanner** that detects sensitive data leaks inside Android APKs.  

Our scanner focuses on **static analysis**, making it lightweight, fast, and safe to use. It is designed for developers, researchers, and security-conscious users who want to verify if their applications are exposing sensitive data before release.

🔍 **Key Features:**
- ✅ Detects **Firebase project IDs & API keys**, checks for exposed databases, storage, and functions  
- ✅ Identifies **AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud service keys** hardcoded in APKs  
- ✅ Flags **dangerous permissions** and **exported components**  
- ✅ Reports **hardcoded API secrets, tokens, and credentials**  
- ✅ Generates a structured **HTML + JSON report** instantly in your browser  

⚡ No software installation. No command-line usage. 100% web-based.
