    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A single misconfigured Firebase bucket in a popular tea delivery app exposed thousands of users' private details to the public internet. Within days, malicious actors exploited the data to doxx victims across social platforms.</p>
    <p>Our <strong>APK Leak Scanner</strong> was built to prevent exactly this kind of disaster.</p>

## ☕ The Tea App Leak: What Went Wrong?

Earlier this year, security researchers discovered that a **tea delivery app**, downloaded by millions of users, had left its **Firebase storage bucket wide open**.  

That meant:  

- No authentication was required  
- Anyone with a browser could list files  
- Sensitive data (phone numbers, order history, even GPS delivery routes) was sitting publicly on the internet  

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:20px; margin:20px 0; background-color:#f7f7f7; padding:20px; border-radius:10px;">
  <!-- Left column: image -->
  <div style="flex: 0 0 40%; text-align:center;">
    <img src="assets/bucketExploit.png" alt="Bucket Exploit Graphic"
         style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:100%; max-width:200px; height:auto; border-radius:8px; box-shadow:0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
  </div>

  <!-- Right column: text -->
  <div style="flex: 0 0 60%;">
    <p>Once attackers noticed, the exploitation was swift:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The bucket was scraped using automated tools</li>
      <li>Personal details were aggregated</li>
      <li>Thousands of innocent users were <strong>doxxed</strong> on forums and Telegram groups</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>root cause</strong> wasn’t a zero-day. It wasn’t a sophisticated hack.</p>
    <p>It was a <strong>simple misconfiguration</strong> that no one caught.</p>
  </div>

## 🔍 Why This Matters for Developers

Today’s apps don’t just live on phones. They are tightly coupled with **cloud services**:  

- Firebase  
- AWS S3  
- GCP Buckets  
- Azure Storage  
- Dozens of other backends  

When developers hardcode cloud service IDs, API keys, or expose unauthenticated storage, the entire **userbase is put at risk**.  

The Tea App incident is just one of many. It could happen to anyone rushing to push code to production without a final security scan.

## 🛡️ How APK Leak Scanner Prevents These Issues

<div style="background-color:#f7f7f7; padding:20px; border-radius:10px; margin:20px 0;">
  <p style="text-align:left; margin:0 0 20px 0;">
    <strong>THAT'S WHERE OUR TOOL COMES IN!</strong>
  </p>

  <img src="assets/workFlow.png" alt="Work Flow Graphic"
       style="display:block; margin:0; width:30%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; box-shadow:0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>

  <p style="text-align:left; margin:0 0 20px 0;">
    <strong>APK Leak Scanner</strong> is a lightweight static analysis tool that:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin-left:20px; text-align:left;">
    <li>✅ <strong>Scans Android APKs</strong> for embedded cloud service configurations (Firebase, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Detects public-facing buckets</strong> and warns you before attackers do</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Flags hardcoded secrets, tokens, and API keys</strong></li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Analyzes permissions and exported components</strong> for potential abuse</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Generates professional reports</strong> in HTML format for display right in the site</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align:left; margin:20px 0 20px 0;">
    Our scanner doesn’t replace a full pentest or enterprise-grade suite — but it fills the <strong>critical blind spot</strong> that allowed the Tea App disaster to happen.

## ⚖️ A Note on Responsibility

We built APK Leak Scanner to empower **responsible developers** and **security teams**.  

- 🚫 Do **not** use it to target apps you don’t own or have explicit permission to test  
- ✅ Do use it as part of your **defensive security practice**  

We believe better tools in the hands of developers mean fewer headlines like the Tea App breach.
