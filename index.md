    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A single misconfigured Firebase bucket in a popular tea delivery app exposed thousands of users' private details to the public internet. Within days, malicious actors exploited the data to doxx victims across social platforms.</p>
    <p>Our <strong>APK Leak Scanner</strong> was built to prevent exactly this kind of disaster.</p>

## ☕ The Tea App Leak: What Went Wrong?

Earlier this year, security researchers discovered that a **tea delivery app**, downloaded by millions of users, had left its **Firebase storage bucket wide open**.  

That meant:  

- No authentication was required  
- Anyone with a browser could list files  
- Sensitive data (phone numbers, order history, even GPS delivery routes) was sitting publicly on the internet  

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="assets/bucketExploit.png" alt="Bucket Exploit Graphic" 
       style="display:block; margin: 20px auto; width:30%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; box-shadow:0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
</p>

Once attackers noticed, the exploitation was swift:  

- The bucket was scraped using automated tools  
- Personal details were aggregated  
- Thousands of innocent users were **doxxed** on forums and Telegram groups  

The **root cause** wasn’t a zero-day. It wasn’t a sophisticated hack.  
It was a **simple misconfiguration** that no one caught.

## 🔍 Why This Matters for Developers

Today’s apps don’t just live on phones. They are tightly coupled with **cloud services**:  

- Firebase  
- AWS S3  
- GCP Buckets  
- Azure Storage  
- Dozens of other backends  

When developers hardcode cloud service IDs, API keys, or expose unauthenticated storage, the entire **userbase is put at risk**.  

The Tea App incident is just one of many. It could happen to anyone rushing to push code to production without a final security scan.

**APK Leak Scanner** is a lightweight static analysis tool that:  

✅ **Scans Android APKs** for embedded cloud service configurations (Firebase, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)  
✅ **Detects public-facing buckets** and warns you before attackers do  
✅ **Flags hardcoded secrets, tokens, and API keys**  
✅ **Analyzes permissions and exported components** for potential abuse  
✅ **Generates professional reports** in HTML, CSV, and JSON formats  

Our scanner doesn’t replace a full pentest or enterprise-grade suite — but it fills the **critical blind spot** that allowed the Tea App disaster to happen.

## 📈 Why Security-Minded Developers Love This

- **Fast:** Upload your APK and get results in minutes  
- **Transparent:** Clear reports with remediation advice  
- **Focused:** Finds what *actually* leaks, not just noise  
- **Free:** Open-source and community-driven  

By integrating this tool into your CI/CD pipeline, you can **stop a leak before it ever hits production**.

## ⚖️ A Note on Responsibility

We built APK Leak Scanner to empower **responsible developers** and **security teams**.  

- 🚫 Do **not** use it to target apps you don’t own or have explicit permission to test  
- ✅ Do use it as part of your **defensive security practice**  

We believe better tools in the hands of developers mean fewer headlines like the Tea App breach.
